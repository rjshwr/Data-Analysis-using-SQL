NFT Transaction Analysis:

Introduction-
In recent times, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a captivating technology garnering global attention. NFTs represent digital assets stored securely on blockchain platforms. In the past year alone, the NFT market witnessed transactions exceeding $22 billion, driven by a combination of art appreciation, speculative investment, and fear of missing out.
Despite the buzz around NFTs, their future remains uncertain due to concerns over rampant scams within the largely unregulated industry and environmental sustainability issues related to blockchain technologies.
Nevertheless, the potential for profit within the NFT space is undeniable. An intriguing aspect of NFTs is their immutable natureâ€”all transactional data is permanently recorded on the blockchain, providing a rich source of data for analysis.
